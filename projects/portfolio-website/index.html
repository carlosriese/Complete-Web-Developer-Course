            <p>Almost a decade ago I was busy teaching math to teenagers at three schools in London and Cambridge. Since I’m a bit of a coding geek, I also built websites on the side for friends and family. I soon learned that web development was a very lucrative career choice, so I gave up my successful (and sometimes stressful) job as a teacher to build websites. Today, I couldn’t be happier with that decision.</p>
            <p>After building websites for about seven years, I noticed a lot of people struggling to learn how to code. I wanted others to have the same freedoms that I enjoyed, so I started teaching web development</p>
            <p>I'm familiar with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP7 and MySQL. Checkout some of the projects I've done below.</p>
